# STATE

Build order and current status for tickflow v0.1. The frozen design lives in

compose stack with dev and bench profiles` · `feat: add exchange ingesters with
normalization` · `feat: add capture and sanity commands` → **stop at the feed-sanity gate:
Rishik reviews feed sanity, ADR-001 records pass/fail.** ⛔ Also the git checkpoint: repo
